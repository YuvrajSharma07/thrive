				<h1 class="text-center" style="padding: 20px">Why Drag Queens are Reading Stories to Kids<div class="text-right"> - Sonam Joshi, Times Of India</div></h1>
				<p class="para">
                    A couple of months ago, Neha Pandit took her son Dylan and daughter Trisha for an unusual weekend outing — a storytelling session by two drag queens in Delhi’s Lalit Hotel. That April afternoon, dressed in bright costumes and wigs, drag queens Lush Monsoon and Betta Naan Stop sang, danced and read aloud a story about a rainbow-coloured, gender-neutral character named Elphie in front of 30-odd kids between the ages of 5 and 12.<br><br>
                    Lush Monsoon, aka Ayushmaan, a 27-year-old human rights lawyer in Delhi who has been
                    performing in drag for two years, says the idea was that the kids get to see someone who is
                    different, someone who is not represented in their world. “We didn’t have to lecture them — that
                    they got to see people dressed in clothes not ascribed to their gender was itself a break in their
                    understanding of gender and a way to take the shock value away,” says Ayushmaan, hopeful that
                    this will make them accommodative of other people’s identities.<br><br>
                    Both the monthly Drag Queen Story Hour, which will travel to other cities in the coming months and
                    the new Elphie children&#39;s book series, are the brainchild of Keshav Suri, executive director of the Lalit
                    group. They were launched with the aim of encouraging children to look beyond gender stereotypes,
                    accept differences and prevent bullying of LGBT kids. “Though I had a supportive family, I faced a lot
                    of ridicule as a kid,” Suri says. “I consider myself lucky that the experience didn&#39;t scar me for life. But
                    the same may not be true for other kids.&quot;<br><br>
                    As the LGBT community has gained greater acceptance in India post the court verdict decriminalising same-sex consensual relationships, activists are trying to prevent bigotry from taking root by reaching out to the youngest hearts and minds. Mumbai-based educator and researcher Chintan Girish Modi, who facilitates workshops on queer issues, identities and experiences, says there has been a rise in the number of schools that recognise the need to have conversations around LGBT issues. In the last two years, Modi has held workshops for school students and teachers in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Patna Delhi, Chennai and Kanpur using educational tools such as excerpts from Pakistan&#39;s first anti-homophobia children&#39;s book, My Chacha is Gay, and videos of first-person stories about being queer, as well as creative writing and storytelling exercises. &quot;I&#39;ve been surprised by the amount of knowledge children already have about the rainbow flag and so on. Often students ask me how can they be better allies, why their school doesn&#39;t do more, if it can have its own pride march and why their uniforms are not gender-neutral,” says Modi, adding that he&#39;s also surprised by &quot;the ignorance of teachers who often come with layers of conditioning.&quot;<br><br>
                    Such initiatives also help children find role models they can identify with, says Ayushmaan. “As a queer person growing up in Ranchi, I would have wanted to see more characters in storybooks or media which represented me and spoke about the issues that I had to deal with. It would have been easier to find myself if I had that representation,&quot; says Ayushmaan.<br><br>
                    Though initially nervous about the reactions of their young audience, the drag queens were pleasantly surprised by the kids' curiosity about their hair, costumes, fake eyelashes and coloured lenses, and ability to grasp the story's message of acceptance.<br><br>
                    Neha Pandit, an entrepreneur, was startled to find her eight-year-old ask the drag queens, and later her, why they were men dressed as women. “People may dress differently, live differently and eat different foods, but it's important to make kids aware that this is okay and it's their choice,” she says.<br><br>
                    Some of the best lessons, however, come from peers. In 2013, students of Delhi's Tagore International School started a campaign called Breaking Barriers to raise awareness on LGBT issues, which has grown by leaps and bounds since then. “While discussions on gender equality and violence against women were common in schools, there existed an institutional void when it came to variation in gender, sex and sexuality and the trauma experienced by non-normative young people,” says former student Sohini Chakrabarti, 19, who co-founded the campaign to destigmatise being ‘different.<br><br>
                    Breaking Barriers tied up with NCR-based NGO Nazariya to train 30-35 volunteers from classes 9 to 12 every year. These volunteers, in turn, make presentations to students from other classes. While students of classes 6 to 8 are introduced to concepts of gender discrimination, stereotypes, and differences, those in classes 9 to 12 are taught definitions of terms such as bisexuality and sexual orientation as well as legal rights and representation of queer people in media. Over the years, this has helped dispel many myths among students. “We are a safe space for people to come out,” says Prarthana, a class 11 student and president, Breaking Barriers.<br><br>
                    The campaign also includes a 'pride' bulletin board, where students discuss issues such as the decriminalisation of homosexuality, an e-magazine and an online portal for students to express themselves anonymously. They also participate in the annual Delhi Queer Pride parade, and hold workshops in other public and private schools, including DAV Public School and Kendriya Vidyalayas.<br><br>
                    Bothered by the rampant use of homophobic terms in his school in Mumbai, 20 year-old Kabir Karamchandani decided to start an LGBT support group a few months after graduating from Bombay International School in 2017. Members of Garv, as the student-led collective is called, use an age-appropriate presentation prepared by Karamchandani to make students aware that belittling or taunting a school mate on the basis of sexual identity is not on. “Often, students don't understand the impact of their words," says Karamchandani, 20. “This sort of awareness building is crucial to prevent discrimination.”
