              <p>Imagine the plight of a trans* or inter-sex person going through an application, which asks the question: “What is your gender?” and only has two options: Male or female.</p>

									We all have grown up hearing jokes and gags about trans* people. We have been accustomed to ridicule them as Chaka or Hijra. But have we really thought about the plight of these people? The challenges these people go through?<br><br>
									<b>Manabi Bandyopadhyay</b>, India’s first transgender college principal in a recent interview said she suffered emotional and physical abuse from her family and peers when she was a college student and was even suspended by college authorities due to her refusal to behave as a heterosexual.<br><br>
									Khushwant Singh in his portrayal of <b>Bhagwati</b>, a female –Hijera prostitute from Lal Kuan, New Delhi talks about the pain and difficulty this community goes through. He points out how they face rejection in every field. Their parents disown them; they have noshelter, no healthcare facilities or job opportunities.<br><br>
									Even today, after the recognition of a third gender by the Supreme Court of India, many are forced to work as sex-workers and other are forced into begging.<br><br>
									The Indian constitution, guarantees equality to all and states “Equality before law, prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, <b>gender</b> or place of birth, and equality of opportunity in matters of employment, abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles”<br><br>
									But are trans* peoplereally equal? Furthermore, do we <b>accept</b> them as equal?<br><br>
									Light might disperse into seven colours but we can’t understand anything beyond black or white. There may exist a rainbow country but a rainbow society still needs to be formed.<br><br>
									I want to know:  Why do we want to define everything? Why do we want to characterize people with their traits and qualities? Why do we generalize people? Why do we not believe in exclusiveness?<br><br>
									We have defined certain rules for each gender.Traits like gentleness, empathy, sensitivity, and others are associated with femininity while traits like strength, courage, independence are associated with masculinity.<br><br>
									But, what we need to understand is the meaning of the word <b>‘femininity’</b> and <b>‘masculinity’</b> itself!<br><br>
									I believe these words don’t have any meaning and should not have any either. How can any human irrespective of gender be caged and forced to be someone or something they are not. It is the very definition of such words that limit our perception. And because of our limited understanding we are not able to associate any trait with trans* or inter-sexpeople and have been discriminating them ever since.<br><br>
									Gandhi was a sensitive <b>‘man’</b>; Rani Lakshmi Bai was a courageous <b>‘woman’</b>.<br><br>
									So, was Gandhi feminine or Lakshmi Bai masculine?<br><br>
									We need to shatter our self-formed barriers and accept all as one. One true and pure creation of nature. Beyond that everyone is unique and is entitled to be so.

									“Whither has fled the visionary gleam, where is it now the glory and dream?” Wordsworth once wrote. The persons belonging to the LGBT community have come to the frontlines, like fearless roaring lions, often seen standing bravely despite deep wounds that have been inflicted upon them as a casual practice by the common masses.<br><br>
									We are in the middle of a revolution that is abundant in colours, enthusiasm, and forms of art that liberate the soul. We are fighters armed with courage, eyes filled with hope and a heart of steel that refuses to be conquered by defeat or adversity.<br><br>
									The Supreme Court of India, in its judgement of the Naz foundation case inflicted a severe blow upon the gay community by decriminalising Sec. 377 of the Indian penal code that defines sexual intercourse between the same sexes as an unnatural offence. If found guilty under this code, the law sentences imprisonment for life or up to 10 years.<br><br>
									The Apex Court in its wisdom rejected the numerous review petitions filed challenging its archaic perspective. The court chose to turn a deaf ear to the voluminous material that was submitted consisting of FIRs, judgments, affidavits, court orders and fact-finding reports  that documented the rights violations suffered by the LGBT community under the shadow of Section 377, also accompanied by voices of several academicians,  parents of LGBT persons, and mental health  professionals.<br><br>
									The Honourable Apex court held that the challenge to decriminalise section 377 was baseless as the LGBT community was only a “miniscule fraction of the population.” Pehchan, a community based organisation working towards the prevention of HIV Aids and has programming in 17 Indian states has so far counted more than 450,000 men who have sex with men, trans* people and hijras and are still counting. Moreover, in a diverse and plural country like India, it is the responsibility of the judiciary to ensure that the rights of “miniscule minorities” are protected regardless of the majority opinion. One fails to understand with what mind did the judiciary dismiss about half a million of our population as an unimportant miniscule minority, depriving them of basic human rights that are universal in nature and are naturally granted to all citizens of India.<br><br>
									Plato and Aristotle defined law as “an embodiment of reason” whether in the individual or the community. The verdict given against the interest of the gay community in India seems devoid of reason and instead appears to be soaked in deep rooted prejudice, intoxicated by the stupor of one’s own pre-conceived notions.<br><br>
									The impugned judgement has adversely affected the members of the LGBT community who bravely continue on their journey of self-identification, despite of having had their gender identity or sexual orientation questioned, criticised, ostracized and demeaned not only by the wagging tongues of those who claim to know better but also in the letter of the law. This excruciating trial wasn’t supposed to be easy in the first place. Now the verdict poses a clear threat and sets a stage for gross violation of Article 14 and 15 that emphasise on ‘Equality before Law’ and Article 19 and 21 that stand to protect the ‘Right to freedom’ of an individual.<br><br>
									One need not even bother to argue whether and if the apex court considered it necessary to give any solution or remedy addressing the torture and discrimination that the members of LGBT are subjected to. They are often subjected to contemptuous behaviour and tortured by the tyrannical and arbitrary practices of the police that often choose to target them for the sake of it, slapping them with false charges of rape, illicit sale or abuse of drugs, public nuisance and other crimes.<br><br>
									The Preamble and the Constitution of India boasts of having granted equal rights to each individual without any discrimination, acting as a benefactor endowing the right to life of dignity to all. It grants each citizen the right to move the court or to seek aid from the state authorities in case of infringement of one’s rights. Terms like Equality, Liberty, Justice and Fraternity appear hollow and meaningless when one is struggling with outright rejection, unchecked violence, and a confused sense of identity often leading to emotional or mental disorders.<br><br>
									Although undesirable injustice is a common phenomenon, for example an amendment to the Criminal Tribes Act 1871 prohibited eunuchs from appearing dressed or ornamented like a woman in a public place along with prohibiting dancing, playing music and taking part in public exhibition. These laws were later repealed for being unconstitutional.<br><br>
									Hope lives in various forms and the much-criticised Supreme court earned our blessings through its widely celebrated NALSA judgment in 2014, where the Bench of Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and A.K. Sikri said that the “recognition of transgender as a third gender is not a social or medical issue but a human rights issue. Trans* people are also citizens of India. The spirit of the Constitution is to provide equal opportunity to every citizen to grow and attain their potential, irrespective of caste, religion or gender.”<br><br>
									With respect to the subject of sexual freedom and expression it may seem that the worst has already happened, but the best is still to come. We shall create the best ourselves with dauntless perseverance, standing strong, knowing that we’re not wrong. It becomes a lot easier when we have the timeless support of Sigmund Freud who wrote ‘homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them. (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime – and a cruelty, too.’

								</div>
								<div class="modal-body">
									In a number of countries, the right for LBGT+ to marry is being legalised. It’s great to see some change happening in the world. I always felt sad for those who couldn’t fully express themselves, who they actually were and who they actually loved. I sometimes thought about what these people would have gone through or are going through when they have to hide their true identities. I’m sure some would have faced and are still facing a lot of pressure from their friends and family to not reveal their identities publicly. I don’t know how many people have ended their lived because of this pressure.<br><br>
									For instance, in India there is so much pressure that the LGBT community faces, that it becomes unimaginable. The mental and physical trauma they go through is unbearable. I have seen people bullying LGBT+ people like they are some kind of aliens. They’re actually creatures from god like all of us and have right to whatever human beings do.<br><br>
									It just breaks my heart when I see people with a cheap mentality around me. A guy wearing a pink shirt is often characterised as gay and I fail to understand why. Is it because of our stereotypical thinking that pink is a feminine colour or is it because we like troubling innocent people for no good reason and who just want to live happily and freely like all of us? I don’t really get what exactly the point is behind this. Maybe it is how people usually are.<br><br>
									No matter how educated we become and whatever we do, we will not treat everyone equally and with respect. Why do we need to show the world that we support a cause? Why can’t we accept those people rather than showing off? A rainbow means colours and life but the question is “are we really filling someone’s life with pride and colours or are we making that person feel even worse?”<br><br>
									I think people everywhere are equal and possess equal rights. It is just inhuman to treat anyone unequally. It is high time that we start showing some humanity towards our fellow beings. There is a reason why god has made people in a certain way and it is part of their freedom whether they want to spend their lives with a man, woman, or both. It’s entirely that individual’s call and we have no right to interfere in anybody’s life just like we don’t allow anyone, even our parents, to interfere in our lives.<br><br>
									The current situation of the LGBT+ community is sad as people are deprived of their rights and have to hide their identities. What could be worse than hiding yourself and your identity from the world and just following the crowd?<br><br>
									“Being a feminist, I believe in equality and feminism is not about women being superior to men, it’s about women and men being equal, possessing equal rights and freedom, anywhere in the world and not just few countries. I also feel it’s just wrong to categorise people or naming them as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) because these people are not different but they’re just like us. I don’t think there is a need to term a group of people because they love someone of their own choice and not the world’s choice. Love is universal. At last the change has started, I am waiting for it to spread across the globe so that everyone can have a happily ever after.”<br><br>

									<ol>
										<h4><li>What gave you the inspiration to start Breaking Barriers?</li></h4>
										I have always been against the idea of division. I despise the concept on two grounds- first, division cannot possibly remain among equals; it necessarily becomes an exclusionary process that marginalizes those who do not represent the mainstream narrative. Second, it is arbitrary, based on no real differences, but social constructs and conditioning. Gender strikes me as a particularly arbitrary form of social division, giving rise to inequalities, that have no real bases. It is, therefore, that at the beginning of High School, I initiated Breaking Barriers, a gay-straight (GSA) of sorts, which has. over the years, much to great delight, taken a more cross-sectional form. This collective was established to spread awareness about variation in gender and sexuality, and normalize 'non-conformity'.
										<h4><li>Did your teachers and peers support your idea the first time you brought it up?</li></h4>
										Issues surrounding gender and sexuality, especially issues which arise from ideas of variation and non-conformity within gender and sexuality are considered extremely taboo in society. They remain, unfortunately, absolutely beyond the ambit of conversations and dialogues which are considered appropriate for school settings. I was, therefore, a little apprehensive before I begun or initiated breaking barriers in school. Since we begun in a school like ours, Tagore International School, where one promotes a certain degree of liberal education, I did not expect active backlash or very intense negativity from the student body or the teachers’ community. I did, however, expect a kind of hesitance from everyone and I was correct, as it turned out, in expecting the latter.<br><br>
										It, therefore, became a significant challenge for the Breaking Barriers team to ensure that the issues that we were talking about were taken seriously, were not trivialized and were considered real problems that required attention. Our main aim was to remove the stigma attached to discussions around gender and sexuality and to get conversation and dialogue flowing because it is only those things that can remove prejudice from society, from mindsets and actually be successful in creating safe spaces within our school.<br><br>
										In the last few years, since our inception, it gives me great joy to say that with absolute support from our school administration and no real hindrance created by our student body and teachers’ community, we’ve been able to strengthen the movement in our school and also in different institutions that we’ve been able to reach out to in different parts of the world and have gotten several steps closer to create the desirable safe spaces that we wished to. There is, in fact, a lot of activism going on around queer rights, around non conformity in India and all over the world and not all have been as lucky enough as us to receive the kind of support that we have in terms of those who control the space that we started in: our school administration was extremely supportive and the students were also, if not absolutely in tandem with theories, ideologies that we wanted to promote, were at least open to the ideas that we were trying to spread to them.
										<h4><li>Why do you think it’s important that young people like you speak up about social issues such as the issues by the LGBTQI+ community?</li></h4>
										Speaking out and taking action against structural violence and socio economic and cultural injustices in society, it's the responsibility of every citizen of the world. For millennia, those who either do not represent the mainstream narrative or are somehow powerless in front of those who have been traditionally occupying spaces and positions of power have been actively suppressed.<br><br>
										It is our generation, armed with access to knowledge and education as well as ground breaking technology that has the capability to reverse socially and traditionally accepted injustices. It is our responsibility, therefore, to use the powers that we have in a way that we can collectivize and mobilize against all that is wrong in the world.<br><br>
										Young people are the primary stake holders of the planet. Young people are the inheritors of the world we have before us and it is time we take matters into our own hands.<br><br>
										The world is inherently an unequal and an imbalanced place. To go ahead and reverse these imbalances and inequities is a very difficult, mammoth structural task. The first step to achieving that perhaps is to look within and to is to recognize, understand and check our own privileges, because sure it’s important to rise up against injustices that are taking place against you, that are affecting you directly and very actively. But, it’s also important to develop a common consciousness of everyone.<br><br>
										It is also important to understand that injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.<br><br>
										It is important to understand that it’s not about actively getting hurt yourself, it is about the kind of negativity which exists in society and which you’re allowing to exist and is actively oppressive towards some. It is only through this common consciousness of young people can we save the planet from its certain end.
